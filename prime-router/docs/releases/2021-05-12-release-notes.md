  "timestamp" : "2021-05-11T20:05:02.571867Z",
  "topic" : "covid-19",
  "reportItemCount" : 25,
  "destinations" : [ {
```

### Addition of Quality Check

A basic Quality check on certain fields is now applied to Covid-19 data before sending it to downstream public health departments.
```
       // valid human and valid test
        "hasValidDataFor(" +
            "message_id," +
            "equipment_model_name," +
            "specimen_type," +
            "test_result," +
            "patient_last_name," +
            "patient_first_name," +
            "patient_dob" +
        ")",
        // has valid location (for contact tracing)
        "hasAtLeastOneOf(patient_street,patient_zip_code)",
        // has valid date (for relevance/urgency)
        "hasAtLeastOneOf(order_test_date,specimen_collection_date_time,test_result_date)",
        // able to conduct contact tracing
        "hasAtLeastOneOf(patient_phone_number,patient_email)"
```

### Adds Reporting Facility Name to PID.3.4.1
The PID.3.4.1 field should contain the name of the reporting facility that has assigned the patient their ID. This has been added.

The field will also properly truncate if the state requires truncation of HD fields.
